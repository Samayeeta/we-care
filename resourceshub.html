            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The biotech industry is stepping in to help bridge the gap in access to healthcare for mood disorders, addiction, and other common mental health conditions with a new type of treatment — prescription digital therapeutics. 
                
                Other than that, oncologists use psychotherapy as well.
               
                <p>
                Patients with advanced cancer are more likely to experience emotional distress and mental conditions. Oncologists play a vital role in identifying these diseases, delivering first-line care, and referring patients for further assessment and treatment when appropriate.

                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">PDTs are software-based interventions intended to prevent, manage, or treat mental or physical conditions. 
                    In contrast to the multitude of wellness apps readily available for download onto your smartphone, PDTs are held to the same standards as pharmacotherapy in terms of safety, efficacy, instructions for use, and quality. 
                    Like traditional medications, PDTs are approved by the FDA after sufficient clinical evidence is presented to support safety and efficacy, and they are prescribed to patients by healthcare providers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, four PDTs have been cleared by the FDA. These include three products developed by Pear Therapeutics (reSET®, reSET-O®, and SomrystTM) and a game-based device developed by Akili Interactive (EndeavorRxTM).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. reSET:reSET, the first Prescription Digital Therapeutic (PDT) to receive authorization from FDA to improve disease outcomes, is a 90-day PDT for Substance Use Disorder (SUD) intended to provide cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as an adjunct to a contingency management system, for patients 18 years of age and older who are currently enrolled in outpatient treatment under the supervision of a clinician.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. reSET-O:  reSET-O, the first PDT to receive Breakthrough Designation and authorized by FDA in December 2018, is an 84-day Prescription Digital Therapeutic (PDT) for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) intended to increase retention of patients in outpatient treatment by providing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as an adjunct to outpatient treatment that includes transmucosal buprenorphine and contingency management, for patients 18 years or older who are currently under the supervision of a clinician.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Somryst® is the first and only prescription digital therapeutic indicated to treat chronic insomnia. Somryst is intended to improve insomnia symptoms by providing neurobehavioral intervention (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia – CBT-I) to adults 22 years of age and older with chronic insomnia.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. EndeavorRx: It is a digital treatment indicated to improve attention function as measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8-12 years old with primarily inattentive or combined-type ADHD who have a demonstrated attention issue and should be considered for use as part of a therapeutic program. It has been demonstrated to improve attention function in children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">Psychotherapy is the therapeutic treatment of mental illness provided by a trained mental health professional. 
                    Psychotherapy explores thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and seeks to improve an individual’s well-being.
                    Psychotherapy paired with medication is the most effective way to promote recovery. Examples include: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, etc.
                    According to the most recent systematic review, there is insufficient trial evidence to judge the effectiveness of antidepressants or psychotherapy in the treatment of major depression in cancer patients.
                    However, several small-scale studies of psychotherapy (particularly CBT) have shown that it can help cancer patients with depressive symptoms. Evidence suggests that a number of treatment models, including educating oncology nurses to diagnose and manage depression in cancer patients, exercise (even in patients with advanced disease), and cognitive therapy administered via videophone to terminally ill patients, are effective for depression.

                PDTs may offer potential for an improved safety profile compared to drugs commonly used to treat conditions such as pain, depression, and anxiety, and they also represent increased accessibility to many patients, at a lower cost. Furthermore, patients may feel more comfortable engaging with a PDT application for certain types of behavioral therapy.
                In addition to providing easy access to care, PDTs help with another problem. Heterogeneity is a challenge that biotech is well suited to address, since digital products can be customized to very specific populations, he told Medscape Medical News.
                 Digital therapeutics offer another advantage that drugs, therapy, and traditional medical devices cannot: data collection. In therapy especially, activities such as journaling and tracking cravings can be crucial to improvement, but compliance is low.

                With an effective therapist, science shows that psychotherapy even works better in the long-term and is more enduring than medication.
                In fact, not only is it more cost-effective, but psychotherapy leads to fewer relapses of anxiety and mild to moderate depression than medication use alone—so much so that Norwegian Health Authorities have issued new guidelines concerning treatment of mild to moderate depression and anxiety, stating that psychological interventions, not medications, should be applied first.
               So what's stopping psychotherapy for being the go-to treatment for nonpsychotic conditions? 
               For one thing, major pharmaceutical companies heavily market their medications directly to the public and health professionals, said speaker Steven Hollon, PhD. While therapy is getting sharper, more effective, and more enduring, it is continuing to lose market share to medication.
               There is an increased effort by psychologists and APA to change attitudes and make psychotherapy a first-line treatment. With evidence-based treatment guidelines under development, and the move for an official statement by APA on psychotherapy's effectiveness, one day medication may lose its market share to psychotherapy.
